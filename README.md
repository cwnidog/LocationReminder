## LocationReminder
==================

# MapButton:
------------
* Get your project setup in ObjectiveC
* Create a single view controller, that has a map view that takes up most the screen, and 3 buttons below it.
* The 3 buttons should set the region on the map view to 3 cool locations, you pick the locations.
* Implement Stack and Queue in ObjectiveC. You can implement them in the same project as your map app is in, since ObjectiveC
does not support playgrounds
